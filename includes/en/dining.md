### Jack & Fin's

Man oh man I like their grilled cheese sandwiches.  Also, cupcakes, if
you're into that sort of thing.  Wildbloom Beer is upstairs in the
same building (hint).

### Littleton Diner

A classic diner.  Their corned beef hash is the best in town.  Their
buckwheat and whole wheat pancakes are also very good.

### Wildbloom Beer

Very good (and inventive) beer here.  They don't offer food, but Jack
& Fin's is downstairs, and you can bring your food up.
