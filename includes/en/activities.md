### Downtown Littleton

A nice place for walking, dining, and checking out shops.

Littleton's downtown is excessively charming.  It's New England
distilled.  Check out the [candy counter][candy], the diners, the old
mill buildings (which now produce pizza and beer instead of lumber and
flour), and shops of all kinds.

We recommend going to the covered bridge to see the Ammonoosuc river.
After you cross to the south, if you turn right and walk for a short
while, you can cross back to the north over an old, bouncy [suspension
bridge][bounce] (Justin thinks this is fun).

### Crawford Notch

Many trailheads and views of Mount Washington.

The White Mountains has "notches" (like "passes" in the west or "gaps"
in the south), and Crawford Notch is a great one.

[Mount Willard][willard] is a short (strenuous but achievable) hike
with an excellent view.

The [Mount Washington Hotel][hotel] is nearby.  It's big, old, and
beautiful.  We suggest exploring inside (check out the speakeasy) and
then getting lunch at the pub in the basement.  It has terrific views
of Mount Washington proper.

The [Cog Railway][cog] is a unique kind of train that climbs to the
top of Mount Washington.  This is really cool.  The views are
stupendous, and the weather at the top is dynamic!  Bring a jacket,
even if you think it's warm out.  It's very popular, so plan to [get
tickets][tickets] in advance.

### Franconia Notch

Tremendous views and hiking opportunities.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d11452.611210763367!2d-71.69162986873854!3d44.14209398378502!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4cb47c3210589007%3A0xa0a59140fd528490!2sFranconia%20Notch!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1689515209716!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="400" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

It's pretty just to drive through, but it's also where a lot of
trailheads are.

[The Basin][basin] is lovely, and it's steps away from the parking
lot.  You can also walk up the nearby [Basin Cascade Trail][cascade]
to see more waterfalls over granite slabs with big pools to take a dip
in.  This is one of our favorite spots to take visitors.

[Lonesome Lake][lonesome] is a medium difficulty hike that goes up to
one of the mountain huts.  You can get a snack at the hut and sit by
the pond.  We love this place.

If you are ambitious, hiking [Franconia Ridge][ridge] is undeniably
awesome.  It's Sophie's favorite hike in the Whites.  But be warned!
It's difficult, and it's an all day hike.

### Kancamagus Highway

A scenic drive with beautiful waterfalls.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2867.5871295468705!2d-71.57160253828805!3d44.05058345231882!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4cb37f5794d2f6b5%3A0xb962a016e3ca912d!2sKancamagus%20Highway!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1689515268448!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="400" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

Kancamagus Highway runs between Franconia Notch and Crawford Notch,
going through North Woodstock, Lincoln, North Conway, and the Mount
Washington area.  These are all nice places, so doing [the whole
loop][loop] and making stops as you go is highly recommended.  It's
about three hours of driving, not counting stops.

[loop]: https://goo.gl/maps/g5EvFoSEhBDP5BiN9

There are several waterfalls along the way. [Lower Falls][lower] is
right off the highway.  [Sabbaday Falls][sabbaday] is a short hike,
but it's one of the prettiest in the area.

### Moore Reservoir

A nice place near Littleton to go swimming, kayaking, and hiking.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d677.0278707929804!2d-71.83814178953985!3d44.33971257514128!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4cb469c7359a0c5b%3A0x2698b19ae28ef330!2sMoore%20Resrvoir%20-%20Dodge%20Hill%20Launch!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1689515519354!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="400" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

A great spot for [paddle boarding][wmas], [kayaking][nck], or just
swimming and relaxing.  There's a small picnic area and beach here.

The hike starts near the porta potty.  It's a casual hike that follows
the edge of the reservoir.

This trail system has an entrance next to our house in Littleton, so
we use it often.

### A few more places of interest

[Lost River Gorge](https://goo.gl/maps/TP6WiMhDJCSWSH4W7) has neat
caves that you can squeeze and shimmy through.  Justin loves this.

[Fairbanks Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/vaSMgp4aHVuu9ctS8) in St.
Johsbury has a nice collection of animal and historical specimens and
science exhibits.  It's also good for kids, and there are good
restaurants in the downtown area.
