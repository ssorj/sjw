### The Cohos Trail Association (TCTA)

Sophie and Justin hiked this wonderful trail in northern New Hampshire
in July 2020, and Sophie now serves on the board of the TCTA. The TCTA
is an all-volunteer organization, so donations go directly to
maintaining and improving the trail and to developing resources for
hikers.
